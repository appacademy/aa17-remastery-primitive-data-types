# You are given three inputs: a string, one letter, and a second letter.

# Write a function that returns `True` if every instance of the first letter
# occurs before every instance of the second letter.

# Look at the String Methods documentation to possibly help you find some
# methods that can make this easier.
# https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=strings#string-methods

# Write your function here.

print(first_before_second("a rabbit jumps joyfully", "a", "j"))

print(first_before_second("happy birthday", "a", "y"))
print(first_before_second("precarious kangaroos", "k", "a"))
